**Nothing is perfect**

1. Software development is an iterative process: write code, test, get feedback, refactor and repeat.

   - The software should be flexible and easy to edit.
   - Avoid writing code that is too rigid and complicated. Professionalism is different from perfection; focus on achieving optimal results.

2. Don't ask for more time to "refactor code".

   - Refactoring code is the process of reorganizing code without changing the business.
   - Programmers need to know that they must refactor immediately after implementing the feature. However, we often only focus on making features. This makes the code difficult to edit, difficult to read, and you will have to ask for more time to rework and rework.
     Add task refactor to the feature development process.

3. Misunderstanding about "legacy code".

   - Many people think that legacy code is old code, but that is not the case. According to Michael Feathers, legacy code is code without testing. Without testing, you cannot refactor or fix it.
   - For example, an old Next.js project with good tests is still maintainable code, not legacy code. Don't follow technologies just because they are new and exciting.

4. Blindly "best practices".

   - There are many best practices in software development such as clean architecture, SOLID principles, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, TDD, BDD, CI/CD, etc. They were invented with good intentions, but should not be followed blindly.

5. Self-reliance

   - I have seen many young programmers trying to demonstrate their problem-solving skills. They often get stuck with problems that have been solved before. Not to do so. Don't reinvent the wheel.
   - The most talented people in the world are those who stand on the shoulders of giants.
   - When working in a team, you will realize that you can learn a lot from more experienced colleagues. They are your "giants". Learn from them and don't waste your time.

6. Loss of self-awareness when entering a "flow" state

   - Have you ever experienced a state of "flow"? That's when you're completely immersed in your work, feeling energized and focused. As a programmer, the state of "flow" makes the code seem to write itself.
   - But be careful – you might be "working hard not working smart". I often find myself overcomplicating things when in "flow". Even Robert C. Martin, author of “Clean Code,” has experienced loss of productivity when in this state.
   - To proactively break the "flow" state, I recommend using the Pomodoro technique. This is a time management method, you work for 25 minutes and rest for 5 minutes. It helps maintain concentration and avoid unconsciousness.

7. **Not physically active**.

   - Working as a software engineer requires sitting in front of a computer for hours, typing and looking at the screen. When we are in a state of "flow", we easily forget about our health. But remember, health is most important. The brain cannot function well if the body is not healthy.
   - Try to exercise every 30 minutes. Get up, stretch, walk around and drink water.

8. Forget the fun of being a programmer.

   - When I first started programming, I was excited to solve problems, create useful software, and learn every day.
     But over time, I began to forget that joy, focusing on "clean code", pursuing "best practices" and solving "hard problems". I no longer write my own code because I'm too busy with work. Where did my creativity go?
   - Take time for personal projects (pet projects), learn new things and do interesting things. At work, discuss new technology with colleagues, even if you don't use it in the project. This helps maintain motivation and inspiration.

9. Be a "coder", not a software engineer.

   - There is a difference between "coders" and software engineers. "Coder" just writes code, while a software engineer is someone who solves problems with code. There are two main reasons you shouldn't just be a coder:
     "Coder" will be replaced by AI in the future (actually happening).
   - People care about how you solve problems, not your code.
     Be a problem solver, understand the problem, find the best solution and execute with code. That's the job of a software engineer.
