We will create a private bucket and upload some images for the workshop.

### Create bucket

1. In the [S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3), click **Create bucket**.

2. Create private bucket.

- **Bucket name**: _somethings-secrect-aq1809_.

- Different from the step of creating a public bucket, so that objects cannot be accessed from the internet, we keep _Block all public access_.

3. Configure CORS so CloudFront can easily send requests to the bucket.

Go to the private bucket, select the _Permissions_ tab, scroll to _Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)_, click **Edit**.
