In this section, i will set up a simple budget so we can monitor the expenses we have spent during the month. If the threshold is exceeded, budget will send an email notification to the email we have registered with budget.

### Set up a budget

Let's say you want to set up a monthly cost budget of $500 for your AWS account and receive alerts when costs reach 85% and 100% of the budget.

1. Open the [Billing and Cost Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement) console, find **Budgets**.

2. Click **Create budget**.

3. Select budget template.

- Select **Use a template**. **Customize** is a more complex level of management, allowing users to create and customize budgets according to specific needs, helping to manage costs and use resources effectively.

- There are 4 templates you can select from:
  - **Zero spend budget**: Warns you of all costs incurred that exceed the _Free Tier_ limit on your AWS account. Additionally, it can be used for inactive accounts.
  - **Monthly cost budget**: Monitor and control total monthly costs.
  - **Daily savings plan coverage budget**: Monitor your Savings Plan coverage every day to ensure you're getting the most out of your savings plans.
  - **Daily reservation ultilization budget**: Monitor daily Reserved Instances (RI) usage to ensure you are effectively using purchased RIs.

We select **Monthly cost budget**.

4. Configure the **Monthly cost budget** parameter.

   - Budget name: _My Monthly Cost Budget_.
   - Budgeted amount ($): _500_.
   - Email recipients: Your email. You can receive notifications of up to 10 emails at a time, enter emails separated by a comma ",".
   - Then click **Create budget**.

### Test exceeded budget

- Notification will be sent to the email we registered if the cost exceeds the threshold. I created a Test Budget to test email notifications.

  - Email shows which account the notification came from with Account ID, and which Budget has reached the threshold.
  - There are 2 types of notifications. _Actual_ when you reach 85% of the threshold and 100% of the threshold, _FORECASTED_ when the cost prediction value reaches the threshold.
  - You can view monthly cost estimates at [Billing and Cost Management home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

- When budget cost exceeds the threshold, we will receive a notification. We see here that our costs have all exceeded 3 Test Budget thresholds, which means that 3 warning emails have been sent to our email one after another.

- In addition, we can use **Budgets** to integrate with **SNS**, **Lambda function**, **Cloudwatch** to control services on AWS whenever there is a warning from **Budgets**.
  - Create an SNS topic in AWS Management Console and register your email address or monitoring application to receive alerts from AWS Budgets.
  - Build an AWS Lambda function to perform the desired action when cost or usage exceeds a threshold. For example, you can write a Lambda function to stop unnecessary EC2 instances or adjust resource configuration.
  - Create a CloudWatch rule to trigger a Lambda function based on notifications from the SNS topic.
