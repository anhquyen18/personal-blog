## Introduce AWS Budget

Cloud cost management is an important factor for every organization using cloud services. When using cloud services like AWS, not tightly controlling costs can lead to unexpected bills and over budgets, negatively impacting finances and business plans. The flexibility and scalability of the cloud also comes with the risk of cost spikes without effective monitoring and management. Therefore, **Budget** is always one of the services mentioned first in cloud courses.

**AWS Budgets** is a powerful tool that helps you plan and manage costs, using AWS resources more efficiently by providing monitoring capabilities and control budget across the AWS platform. With AWS Budgets, you can set budgets for usage costs, and set up alerts when you near or exceed pre-defined budget limits, thereby helping you manage your finances more proactively and effectively.

### Key Features of AWS Budgets

1. Set up Cost and Usage Budgets:

   - Create budgets for total costs or costs for each specific service, each account, each resource group (tags), or each region.
   - Set up budgets for usage metrics such as EC2 hours used, number of S3 requests, etc.

2. Budget alert:

   - Set up alerts when costs or usage near, reach, or exceed a set budget threshold.
   - Receive alerts via email or through Amazon SNS, allowing integration with other monitoring and management systems.

3. Reporting and Monitoring:

   - Viewing detailed reports on AWS resource usage and costs in the AWS Budgets console.
   - Monitoring usage costs in real time, helping you grasp your financial situation quickly and promptly.

4. Integrating with AWS Cost Explorer:

   - Using AWS Cost Explorer to analyze and visualize cost and usage data.
   - Combining with AWS Budgets to optimize AWS resource usage costs.

For me, one of the first things I do when I turn on my computer every morning is to open my account's [Billing and Cost Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement) to see how much it costs. Avoid that one day the cost will increase too high without me even knowing it, maybe during the lab process i use a certain service and forget to delete it, or even have a hacker access it and create a coin mining server.

Therefore, set up a budget to control costs on AWS is an extremely necessary task, the first thing any Developer entering the AWS world must do first.
