### Introduction

IAM Policies in AWS are JSON documents that define access permissions and access restrictions for users, groups, and roles in AWS. These policies dictate what actions are allowed or denied on specific AWS resources.

- IAM Policy is an important tool for managing security and access control in AWS. These policies identify:

  - Who (user, user group, role) can perform the action.
  - What (AWS API actions) can they perform.
  - Which (specific AWS resources) actions can be performed.
  - When and Which Conditions (specific conditions) apply to the action.

- Types of IAM Policy:

  - **Managed Policies**: Policies are managed by AWS or created and managed by you.
    - AWS Managed Policies: Created and managed by AWS, updated automatically when there are new features or changes in AWS services.
    - Customer Managed Policies: Created and managed by you. Allows detailed customization of permissions.
  - **Inline Policies**: Policies are attached directly to a user, group or role. These policies cannot be reused and must be managed individually. Not recommended unless there is a clear purpose.

- Some notes when using IAM Policy

1. Principle of Least Privilege:

   - Only grant the minimum permissions to perform the job.
   - Avoid assigning permissions that are too broad, such as "\*" for all actions or resources.

2. Use AWS Managed Policies when possible:

   - Use AWS managed policies to ensure you always have the most up-to-date and secure permissions.

3. Check and update policies periodically::

   - Make sure policies stay aligned with current business requirements and don't have unnecessary permissions.

4. Using Conditions:

   - Use conditions in policies to granularly control access based on attributes like IP address, time, MFA, and more.

5. Monitoring and logging:

   - Use AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config to monitor and log IAM-related activities and changes.

### Create Customer managed Policy

We will create a Policy that will be attached to the user group _DevGroup_. And test some actions with AWS resources through the user we created.

Create a policy allows to only create EC2 in the _Singapore (ap-southeast-1)_ region, and only create instances with instance type starting with _t2._ to avoid creating excessive instances, which leading to the cost is too great.

1. In the [AWS IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) console, select **Policies**, click **Create policy**.

2. Select **JSON**. Add code to Policy editor.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ec2:RunInstances", "ec2:CreateTags"],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": "ap-southeast-1"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotLike": {
          "ec2:InstanceType": "t2.*"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Statement 1: We need to create tags with ec2.

  - Effect: Allow – Allows action.
  - Action: ec2:RunInstances, ec2:CreateTags – Only allows to run EC2 instances and create tags.
  - Resource: \* – Applies to all resources.
  - Conditions:
    - StringEquals – Use condition to limit implementation in ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) region.

- Statement 2:

  - Effect: Deny – Refuses action.
  - Action: ec2:RunInstances.
  - Resource: arn:aws:ec2:ap-southeast-1::instance/\* – Specifies the resource type.
  - Condition:
    - StringNotLike: Limits instance types starting with t2.

- Statement 3:
  - Effect: Allow – Allows action.
  - Action: Allows EC2 descriptions so users can view the information needed to create EC2 instances, including - regions, images, key pairs, security groups, subnets, and VPCs.
  - Resource: \* – Applies to all resources.

3. Scroll down and click **Next**.

4. Enter policy name _OurAccessControl_.

5. Review the permissions of the json code we just added, then click **Create policy**.

6. Policy is created successfully.

### Attaching policy to user group

- We will attach to the group instead of directly to the user for the following reasons:

  - **Easy management and maintenance**: Once policies are attached to a group, you only need to update that group when permissions need to be changed. All users in that group will automatically receive updated permissions without the need to configure each user individually.
  - **Consistency**: Ensure that all users in the same group have consistent permissions. This helps avoid confusion and errors when configuring permissions for individual users.
  - **Save time**: Attaching policies to groups helps reduce the time needed to manage permissions. You just need to add users to groups instead of setting permissions for each individual user.
  - **Scalability**: As your organization grows, you can easily add users to existing groups without having to reconfigure permissions for each new user.
  - **Enhanced security**: Managing policies through groups makes it easier to control and track permissions. This helps ensure that permissions are managed systematically and in compliance with the organization's security policies.
  - **Delegation of permissions and responsibilities**: Allows administrators to delegate management permissions to different groups to different departments or work groups, creating a clear division of responsibility for access management access.

1. In the [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) console, select _User groups_, select _DevGroup_.

AWS warns us that we have not defined any policy for the group.

2. Switch to the **Permissions** tab, select **Add permissions**, select **Attach policies**.

3. Search for the policy we created, select the policy then click **Attach policies**.

4. Policy is attached successfully.

### Check EC2 accessibility of the user.

Log in to the created user, then access the [EC2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) console, we will try to create an instance in the N. Virginia region.

1. In the console, click **Launch instances**.

![](/storage/prevent-security-risks/iam-2_11.png)

2. Set up EC2.

   - Name and tags: _test-ec2_.
   - Instance type: _t2.micro_.
   - Key pair: _Proceed without a key pair_.
   - Network settings: Select **Select existing security group**, select **default**.
   - Leave remaining parameters as default.
   - Click **Launch instance**.

![](/storage/prevent-security-risks/iam-2_12.png)

3. Unable to create EC2.

The message shows an error, we cannot create an EC2 instance on the _us-east-1 (N. Virginia)_ region. Click **Cancle**.

![](/storage/prevent-security-risks/iam-2_13.png)

4. Switch region to Singapore and click **Launch instance** again.

![](/storage/prevent-security-risks/iam-2_14.png)

5. Set up EC2.

   - Name and tags: _test-ec2_.
   - Instance type: _t3.nano_.
   - Network settings: Select **Select existing security group**, select **default**.
   - Leave remaining parameters as default.
   - Click **Launch instance**

![](/storage/prevent-security-risks/iam-2_15.png)

6. We get the same error in the previous step.

Because we have selected instance type _t3.nano_, which is outside the policy conditions.

Click **Edit instance config**.

![](/storage/prevent-security-risks/iam-2_16.png)

7. Reselect _t2.micro_ type or any t2 type depending on you, then **Launch instance** again.

![](/storage/prevent-security-risks/iam-2_17.png)

8. Instance is created successfully. We will use this instance for the next example.

So we have learned how to limit EC2 resources created by users, you can replace EC2 with other AWS resources to suit reality.
