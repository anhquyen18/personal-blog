Using high cost resource (lambda provisioned concurrency, ECS) costs 700 million in 1 month.</p><p>By the way, I would like to share some basic ways to protect your AWS account, or if you are working in a customer environment, pay attention to the following:</p><ol><li>AWS ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT POLICY</li></ol><ul><li>Use Multi account for the following reasons <ul><li><strong>Perspective on Governance</strong>: Clear separation between production and other environments.</li><li><strong>Payment perspective</strong>: Manage payments for each account.</li><li><strong>Operational perspective</strong>: Minimize the impact of changes and relax AWS service quota limits.</li></ul></li><li>Reference: Best Practices for Organizational Units with AWS Organizations. https://aws.amazon.com/.../best-practices-for.../</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>HUMAN ACCESS CONTROL</li></ol><ul><li>Setting MFA for root user, do not use root user for daily work except in cases of setting on account level.</li><li>IAM users are created for each user, do not use common IAM users.</li><li>Set a strong enough password policy (Minimum 14 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters).</li><li>Additional MFA settings are required.</li><li>The time limit for changing password is 90 days.</li><li>A new password that is the same as any of the four most recent passwords used cannot be reused.</li><li>Immediately after being granted an IAM user, you need to change your password the first time you log in.</li><li>There is a detection and Notification mechanism when root account login (EventBridge + SNS).</li><li>IAM policy for IAM user / IAM group requires minimum permissions.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li>PROGRAM ACCESS CONTROL</li></ol><ul><li>Control access between AWS resources</li><li>All AWS resources are protected by AWS IAM policy. Therefore, your AWS IAM policy should be designed in according to the <strong>principle of least privilege</strong> (do not grant excess permissions).</li><li>Access control based on Organizations SCP.</li><li>Control and prevent resource creation in unwanted Regions (for example, only allow resource creation in 2 Regions Tokyo (ap-northeast-1) and N. Virginia (us-east-1))</li><li>Prevent the creation of high cost resources outside the project scope such as: Glue, EMR, Redshift...</li><li>Prevent creating EC2 or DB with Instance types outside the approval list (expensive instance types).</li><li>Prevent changing settings to some services such as AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, Amazon GuardDuty, Budget, etc.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li>USE ACCESS KEY</li></ol><ul><li>Do not use access key for root account.</li><li>Use access key with minimal permissions.</li><li>Use IAM Role instead of Access key when possible. (eg IAM role for EC2, IAM for Lambda etc).</li><li>Use different access keys for each application.</li><li>Delete unused access keys.</li><li>Do not save access key in source code.</li><li>There is a mechanism to notify when keys are leaked to github (AWS will send a warning email).</li></ul><ol start="5"><li>CONTROLL BUDGET</li></ol><ul><li><p>Set daily Budget and Monthly budget to receive unusual alerts via SNS.</p></li><li><p>Depending on the architecture of your project, consider the following factors:</p><ul><li>Application security</li><li>Network Security</li><li>Data security</li><li>Device security</li><li>SaaS security</li></ul></li></ul><p>Above are some notes I gave, if you feel you need to pay more attention, please share!</p><p>UNDERSTAND -&gt; DO -&gt; LIMIT RISK</p><p>Now let&#39;s dive deeper into some notable points that Mr. <em>Nguyen Phong</em> mentioned in the post.
