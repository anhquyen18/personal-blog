## IAM Overview

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps you securely manage access to AWS services and resources. IAM lets you control who can do what in your AWS account.

Main components of IAM:

- **Users**:
  - Definition: UDefinition: Users are entities that represent a person or an application used to interact with AWS.
  - Features: Each user can have their own login name and password, and can be granted permissions through policies.
- **Groups**:
  - Definition: Groups are collections of users. You can create groups to manage permissions for many users more easily.
  - Features: Policies attached to a group will apply to all users in that group.
- **Roles**:
  - Definition: Roles are IAM entities that you can create to represent access permissions that you want to grant to other applications or users.
  - Features: Roles can be assigned to users, applications, or services to grant temporary access.
- **Policies**:
  - Definition: Policies are JSON documents that define the permissions you want to grant.
  - Features: Policies are granted to users, groups, or roles to access to AWS resources.

You can learn more about AWS IAM [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html).

## Create User and User group

We will create a user and user group to test the permissions we will create in the following step.

Open the [AWS IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) console.

### Create User group

1. In the IAM console, select _User Groups_ then click **Create group**.

2. Enter group name _DevGroup_.

Leave the Add users and Permisson sections blank, we will return to this section later.

2. Configure user information.

- Enter User name (login name) _dev-user-01_, there are 2 types of users, select **I want to create an IAM user**.

  - _AWS Identity Center_: Suitable for large organizations or with multiple AWS accounts, where centralized management, SSO integration, and critical enterprise identity systems are located.
  - _IAM User_: Suitable for small organizations or simpler environments where quick setup and granular control of permissions are required without the need for centralized management and SSO features.

- Password select _Autogenerated password_ because when you log in for the first time you have to change the password when selecting the checkbox _Users must create a new password at next sign-in_ so every password should be the same.

  - This ensures that no one other than the user owner knows the password after the owner's first login, including the Admin who created the user.

- Then, click **Next**.

3. Grant permissions to users.

- There are 3 options:

  - _Add user to group_: Add a user to the group, the user will own all the policies that the group has. A user can be in many groups at the same time.
  - _Copy permissions_: Select another user and when the created user will have all policies of selected user.
  - _Attach policies directly_: Select policies and attach them directly to the user.

- We select **Add user to group**, select **DevGroup**, click **Next**. The reason will be explained in the next session.

6. Sign in to AWS.

   - Open the downloaded _dev-user-01_credentials.csv_ file.
   - Copy the link provided in the _Console sign-in URL_ box and paste it into the browser.
   - Enter username and password provided in the csv file then click **Login**.

7. AWS will ask us to change our password immediately after signing in.

   - We will enter the provided password.
   - The new password will be up to us to use for future access.

8. Sign in successfully.

   - As you can see, our user will be denied access to all unauthorized resources by default.
   - We will use this user to test access to resources in the next session.
